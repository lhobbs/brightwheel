# brightwheel Software Engineering Exercise

○ How to install your application 
To install run "npm install"
To run application run "npm run start"
To view documentation go to http://localhost:3000/documentation

○ Which language, framework and libraries you chose and why 
I chose to do this exercise in NodeJS because it is lightweight, fast and scalable. 
I chose to use hapi because it provides a fast way to build a REST API. It is also the Node framework I am most familiar with.
Joi is the validation module that hapi uses. It provides an easy way to ensure required fields are there and that fields are in the correct data type.
I used Swagger for documentation because it is easy to go to the endpoint and view all methods and test inputs from there.

○ Trade offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you 
might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project 
Hapi provides an easy and robust way to build a REST API, however, Express has slightly better performance.
If I had more time on this project I would have written a better method to parse the HTML.

○ Anything else you wish to include.
