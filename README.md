# brightwheel Software Engineering Exercise

## Set up 
To install run "npm install"
To run application run "npm run start"
To run tests run "npm run test"
To view documentation go to http://localhost:3000/documentation once server is started

## Frameworks and libraries
I chose to do this exercise in NodeJS because it is lightweight, fast and scalable and I chose to use hapi because it provides a quick way to build a REST API. It is also the Node framework I am most familiar with.
Joi is the validation module that hapi uses. It provides an easy way to ensure required fields are there and that fields are in the correct data type.
I used Swagger for documentation because it is easy to go to the endpoint and view all methods and test from there.
I also included some tests with lab and code.

## Tradeoffs
Hapi provides an easy and robust way to build a REST API, however, Express has slightly better performance.

## If I had more time
If I had more time on this project I would have written a better method to parse the HTML, better unit tests and a front end to enter the view and submit data through.
